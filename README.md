# Introduction
This is my first attempt at creating a cli using golang. The idea is simple: call this cli with a single url and by doing so, add said url to my pocket reading list. For this, we'll need to:

- Implement Oauth2 to get a token to interact with pocket
- Call the pocket api
- ???
- Profit
